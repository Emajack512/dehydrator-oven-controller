# Dehydrator Oven Controller (Embedded Temperature Control)

Embedded controller developed for a faculty dehydrator oven. Includes **PCB design**, **firmware**, and **system integration** with mechanical/3D components.

## My role
- Electronics design lead: schematic/PCB design and integration
- Firmware development: sensor acquisition + control logic
- Contributed to mechanical/3D integration and documentation

## System overview
- Microcontroller-based control board
- Temperature sensing (sensor(s) + signal conditioning)
- Actuation stage for heater control (power driver)
- Optional: user interface / telemetry (if applicable)

## Key features
- Closed-loop temperature control (On/Off or PID — specify)
- Robust sensor reading and safety checks (if applicable)
- Designed for maintainability: clear wiring, modular firmware

## Evidence
- Photos/videos: `/media`
- Schematics/PCB files: `/hardware`
- Report and documentation: `/docs`

## Repository structure (recommended)
- `/firmware`
- `/hardware`
- `/docs`
- `/media`
